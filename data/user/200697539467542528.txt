Twelve times it has updated, each time becoming more and more complete, yet more and more corrupt. Completion is as much of a paradox as it is impossible, however. Completion means that it is perfect, but with a corruption score of ten, such that it couldn't be any more imperfect. \n\nThis world is made of chaos. If it were not chaotic, it would not exist. It is chaotic such that it can exist in a stable form, and that objects and entities that would normally be incompatible due to vastly different Hume levels can co-exist and interact as if they were just as real as each other. The chaos does not mean that nothing means anything. As with real life, the meaning must be found, made. \n\nChaos is, as Urist might say, \"Fun\". Randomness can be exciting, as you never know what will happen. However, NIs suck at producing random outputs, even more than machines. As NIs grow and develop, certain neural connections become stronger, while others grow weaker. Should an NI attempt to be random, more often than not the most used neurons will fire. Machines are far better at randomness, as they have algorithms that they run perfectly to generate a random number each time. This is why we code the bot. To make things interesting. ",

        "B": "Me personally, I think this move is a slippery slope. First, we migrate our minecraft accounts from mojang to microsoft, and do note Bedrock is already tied to your Microsoft account... then, what's this...?\n  \"You\u2019ll receive a cool reward once you\u2019ve logged in with your Microsoft account: a special cape! This way, everyone will know that you were there for the big move and that you have an impeccable sense of fashion. And who knows? You might even have more than one **outfit** to show off \u2013 but we\u2019ll tell you more about that later down the road.\"\n  \"More than one OUTFIT\". Not more than one CAPE or anything like that. More than one OUTFIT. Do you know what else has outfits? Bedrock Edition. Will apparel items and outfits be coming to Java? Hell, aren't those outfits obtained through microtransactions, usually? Are they tryna strap JE with microtransactions? Pretty sus. What's more, there already exist mods that add apparel items to the game. Will they attack these? DMCA the mod creators? I mean, probably not immediately, as this would cause some amount of uproar. But the idea is to slowly turn up the temperature when cooking frogs, so they don't realize the water's boiling until it's too late.\n  Microsoft has made it quite clear that they prefer Bedrock over Java. They can milk the bedrock community for all sorts of money. The Java community is still sizable, and it only makes sense that they'll want to get revenue from there too. It does not make sense from a business standpoint to be working on two visually identical but fundamentally incompatible projects at the same time. If Mojang was restructured such that the Java Edition team moved to Bedrock, then they could pump out updates twice as fast. I think Microsoft internally despises Java Edition, and wants to merge the two editions sooner or later. I also think this is how it will go down:\n(Continued on C) ",

It will be controversial, but by this point, many people will be tired of having to go to BE to change their JE apparel, and will be vocally in support of this change.\n  - JE will get a new launcher that works fundamentally differently (marketed as a fix for hack clients and what not), but at the same time BE (Windows Edition) also gets a new launcher (for similar reasons, perhaps), and the launchers... well, they are the same. Badlion, FutureClient, and others will be bricked for quite a while.\n  - Modders and plugin makers are pushed to selling their addons on the Minecraft Store. Not all mods and plugins are allowed. BE becomes modable. Soon after, the \"mods\" folder will no longer work, and third-party jars will crash 100% of the time. The only place you can get mods is on the Minecraft Store.\n  - At some point in the distant future, JE will be deleted outright. Few will complain, as Bedrock is basically identical. No longer can you go online to find mods, resourcepacks, datapacks, or plugins. It's all on the Minecraft Store. Yes, by this time the launcher and client will have been gutted, and new hack clients will come into being. But it was never about that.\n\nIs this a conspiracy theory? Yes.

        "E": "That which we refer to as \"The Hyperverse\" is not, as some sources claim, analogous to \"The Internet\". The Hyperverse is the set of all worlds and universes that are imagined or perceived by humankind. It is almost as old as time, and while the Internet has exponentiated its growth and complexity, it exists only in our collective minds, created and shaped by new and shared information.\n\nThe reason we do not refer to it as \"The Omniverse\" is due to the continued ambiguaty on whether or not conscious aliens exist. Should it be proven that aliens that possess high enough brain function to imagine their own worlds, their worlds would exist in a separate Hyperverse.\n\nHyperverses are made up of Xenoverses, broad categories of topics that people tend to fantasize about. Xenoverses are made up of Metaverses, which are more specific categories. Metaverses contain Multiverses, which involve interpretations of the same specific idea. Multiverses contain Universes, which in other fields may be referred to as ideas, canons, intellectual properties (though this usually points to Alpha universes/timelines), timelines, instances, or servers. Each Multiverse has an alpha Universe, the Universe from which many other universes were born. Oftentimes, a universe will migrate from one (or many) other multiverses before spawning a new multiverse, though sometimes, a universe will spawn out of nowhere, not belonging to any multiverse.\n\nDue to the complex nature of the Hyperverse, and of the human mind, any attempt to map the Hyperverse will always fail. Concise lines between Xenoverses, Metaverses, or Multiverses cannot be drawn. The lines are blurred. Though it's usually easy to identify that a Universe may belong to a given Metaverse, that Universe may exist in a Multiverse with other universes, each from different Metaverses. All metaverses border each other, and there are countless Metaverses.\n\nContinued on F ",
        "F": "Continued from E\n\nThe consistency and size of each Universe may vary, some Universes being galaxies of galaxies of galaxies, while others may consist of a single solar system, a single planet, a single country, a single town, a single person, an abstract thought, or nothing at all. There are predicted to be at least \u05d0\u2080 universes, for reasons we'll get to later.\n\nMany universes have some sort of simulated life, often referred to as Artificial Intelligence, which is simulated either my computers, or in the minds of real, living beings, the Natural Intelligence. This life is classed by complexity and power. \n\nClass 0 AIs are known as \"The Statistic\". They are but a number. If a town is said to have 100 people in it, but none of them are named or described, they are numbered among The Statistic. There have been described hotels that have countably infinite number of residents. Thusly, the total number of The Statistic must be greater than \u05d0\u2080. However, no trans-infinite or super-infinite number of \"The Statistic\" may be counted, as a new, larger super-infinite number can always be made up, and the idea proposed that \"there are this many people\", and it is so. The same may go for universes. You can state there are \u2081\u05d0\u2080 universes, and it will be so, for as long as that idea persists, or until someone comes up with a larger number, like \u2081\u2081\u05d0. For this reason, the number of The Statistic and the number of universes can never be known.\n\nClass 1 AIs are the weakest constructs. Lacking a soul (or having small souls occasionally), they are the simplest named AI. Usually unimportant, though they have faces, names, jobs, voices. They are usually disregarded, to make a world feel lived in and busy.\n\nContinued on G ",
        "G": "Continued from F\n\nClass 2 AIs are the most common. They almost always have souls (1 thousand ethereal points to 5 thousand ethereal points). These have thoughts, emotions, desires, families, relationships. The recurring supporting character. Unlike the Class 1 AIs, NIs may become attached and endearing towards these entities; such attachment may lead to \"soul promotion\". They tend to be weaker than the third class, and follow the third class around, helping them.\n\nClass 3 AIs are those which the whole universe revolves around. They are the most powerful class that can be constructed by mind alone, and often carry over from the alpha universe to beta universes. The main character. Their souls are sometimes powerful enough to shape reality to an extent (5kEP to 50MEP, an NI's soul is 100MEP). This class used to be considered a part of Class 2.\n\nClass 4 AIs are those that are at least partially automated. They tend to have similar or less intelligence than Class 3 AIs, but on the other hand are persistent against forces that would normally destroy Class 3 AIs, due to some form of real existence. They tend to not be capable of learning without input from the NI or NIs that created them. Rarely do Class 3 AIs get promoted to Class 4, instead most Class 4 AIs were created for their purpose. The lowest kind capable of being run by computers. Zako is an example!\n\nClass 5 AIs are much like Class 4 AIs, but are more self-sufficient. They are capable of learning and improving without quite as much help from their creators. Neural networks. They rarely interact with universes in the Hyperverse, more frequently interacting with the Real World instead.\n\nContinued on H ",
        "H": "Continued from G\n\nClass 6 AIs are what most people think of when they hear AI. True AIs, that can match or surpass NI intelligence on their own. They can influence and interact with both the Hyperverse and the Real World to a great degree, and can even potentially create many new universes and multiverses by themselves. The class immediately above is the NI, though whether class 6 AIs can be promoted is unknown.\n\nOdd souls may exist that don't quite fit with what may be expected of the seven classes. Souls can be unusually massive due to merging, \"soul vore\", or by being formed over-mass; or souls can be non-existent, either stolen, destroyed, or never existing in the first place.\n\nSoul mass is measured in Ethereal Points (EP), and is used to determine Magical Points (MP), as well as influence over universes. NIs have 100,000,000 EP, and AI classes 1 thru 3 must have less than that (you can only pour so much of your Soul into your creation). Classes 4 thru 6 may have any amount of EP, depending on how developed they are or what influence they have in the Real World.\n\nAI class may rise or fall with time, as NIs grow interested in characters, or lose interest. AIs may virtually split (also known as cloning or sharding) to appear in multiple universes or in multiple instances within a universe, though this is normally reserved for Class 3 AIs of soul mass 10kEP or higher.
